    	mosquitopopulations from satellite images using Machine\
    	Learning. The tool serves as a replication and advancement\
    	of the work on ‚ÄúCNN Mosquito Habitat Detection Research‚Äù\
    	by Sriram Elango and  Nandini Ramachandran.\n\
    	The tool explores the mosquito distribution datasets\
    	and runs models for mosquito prediction.\
    	The tool also allows users to submit custom satellite\
    	images of affected domains to evaluate\
    	for the presence of mosquito populations across the globe.\n\
    	The data is provided courtesy of the aforementioned work by\
    	Elango et. al. and can be accessed here. Note that the data in\
    	its current form is limited and that this tool is a work in\
